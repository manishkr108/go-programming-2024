**Concurrency and parallelism are two distinct concepts in Go:**

**Concurrency** is about dealing with lots of things at onceâ€”structuring programs where multiple processes run independently, even if they are not actually running simultaneously.


**Parallelism** is about doing lots of things simultaneously, and it requires multiple CPU cores.



**Concurrency in Go**
In Go, concurrency is achieved using goroutines and channels. A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.
