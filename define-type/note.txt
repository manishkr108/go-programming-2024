% ---------Why define new type-------------
    - we can attach methods to newly defined types
    - we can define new types that are more specific than the original type
    % type safety. we must convert one type into another to perform operations with them.
    ? Redability: when we defined a new type lets say type usd float64 we know that new type represents the US Dollar not only floats
