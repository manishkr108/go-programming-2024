% --------------------Scopes In Go ----------------------

    - 1. scope means visibility
    - 2. The scope or the lifetime of a variable is the interval of time during which it exist as the program excutes.
    - 3. A name cannot be declared again in the same scope ( for example a function in the package scope ), but it declear in another scopes.

    in go there are 3 scopes:
    1. package scope
    2. file scope
    3. block(local) scope

     example

     package main 

     import "fmt" // file scope

     const done = false // package scope

     func main(){
        x:= 10 // local (block) scope
        fmt.Println(x)

     }
